Advanced and attractive reports with live controls to your users at frontend.

== Description ==

Frontend Reports gives you the ability to configure and display advanced reports with live controls to your users anywhere.

You can attractively show any report anywhere, in-line on any page or post, using a simple block (or shortcode), or on any sidebar through a configurable widget.

A total of 11 shortcodes (with a block and widget version of each one) that let's you place different reports types divided in:

* Plain reports without any style to let you style them or place anywhere.
* Chart reports to display statistics of the different types and amounts you want like a chart with the earned and lost "Credits" or a chart with achievements earned of all types.
* Graph reports with the ability to optionally display live controls to let users navigate on the different time periods and let them see their old activity (you can disable the live controls to make them display only the time period you want).

In addition, this add-on includes a great number of style options to let you customize each report with the look you want.

Frontend Reports extends and expands GamiPress adding new features.
