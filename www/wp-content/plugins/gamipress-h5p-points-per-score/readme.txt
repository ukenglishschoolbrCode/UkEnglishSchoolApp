Award points based on the user score in H5P.

== Description ==

GamiPress - H5P Points Per Score let's you award a percent of the user score in [H5P](https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/ "H5P") as [GamiPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/gamipress/ "GamiPress") points.

You can configure the percent of the score to award. A few examples:

* A 100% will award the same user score as points (e.g. score of 40 = 40 points).
* A 200% will award the double of the user score as points (e.g. score of 40 = 80 points).
* A 50% will award the half of the user score as points (e.g. score of 40 = 20 points).

Also, you can enable and configure it per points type so you will be able to award a 100% of the score for a specific points type and a 200% for another points type.

In addition, the add-on includes settings to only reward the points only the first time.
